# Feedback Identification Algorithm for Embedded Applications

This repository will house further work on the feedback detection algorithm by Alex Cannan. To see the extensive README submitted with the project, see PROJECT.md.

## To do:

- Integrate FFTW as alternative to Kiss_FFT
- Clean up feedback identification section, isolate parameters
- Figure out automated axis labels in gnuplot
- Change y-axis to a logarithmic scale
