# Feedback Identification Algorithm for Embedded Applications

This repository will house further work on the feedback detection algorithm by Alex Cannan. To see the extensive README submitted with the project, see PROJECT.md.

## To do:

- Revert back to noiseart branch
- Fix Kiss_FFT output
- Clean up feedback identification section, apply tensorflow
- Figure out automated axis labels in gnuplot
- Change y-axis to a logarithmic scale
